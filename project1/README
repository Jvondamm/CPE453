## 1. How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

LWP's schedule and execute by the kernel while a thread management library 
would be a user thread which would be managed by the library itself and 
the kernel wouldn't know anything about it. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Name two ways in which this LWP library API could be improved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The LWP library API could assign priorities to each lwp, which would change 
the simple round_robin() scheduler. 

2. It could also add multithreading.
